### `App description`
Traveling overseas is a fascinating, exciting experience where we may learn 
about history, new cultures, exotic cuisine, and learn about the world.
Nevertheless, when we travel, we usually can’t use our country’s currency. 
Getting foreign currency can be easy, but we should be cautious of where we 
exchange our currency, so we aren’t stuck with a bad exchange rate like banks 
and change shops. it’s good to know the best place to exchange currency so we 
don’t end up in the worst place.
This project introduces a currency exchange application that helps to exchange 
currencies between people in cash without commission.
For example, a person abroad wants to exchange his currency for another type 
without having to deal with a commission charged by the bank/exchange store, 
or he in a place where there are no banks or change shops and doesn’t want to 
drive a long distance to exchange his currency. He can use the application to 
choose the amount and currency type he requires, and the application assists 
with finding a suitable user that agrees to the required exchange. The application 
presents a map and the shortest path to get to the exchange location and a chat 
feature to assist the users to communicate with each other.
The outgrowth of the app is the creation of a social network of active participants.
The app is divided into three major sections, each of which was completed by a 
different team member.
The following were the primary components of the app's development:
- Create the frontend and screen design for the application.
- Building a server side and developing the logic for the existing 
functionality.
- Connecting and configuring the project's databases.
